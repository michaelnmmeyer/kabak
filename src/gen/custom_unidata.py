"""
Adds decomposition mappings for some characters to the Unicode database, and
prints the result.

To do things the right way, we should handle these characters separately, but it
is simpler to put everything at the same place. We need to use NKFC
normalization anyway, so why not trying to stuff everything there?

Previously, we had a special function to fold ligatures to ASCII, but this
was clunky at best. Besides, there is no reason to not fold them since other
ligatures (ĳ, Ĳ, ﬂ, ﬀ, ﬃ, ﬄ, ﬅ) are systematically folded.

The only issue is that we can't do true NFKC normalization anymore, but this is
not a problem for now.
